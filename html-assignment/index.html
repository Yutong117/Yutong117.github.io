            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, everyone. My name is <em>Yutong Liu</em>. I'm from China. I am a student in Algonquin College.I came to Ottawa at September 1<sup>st</sup> and this is my first year. I'm very excited to study <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program. I am interested in visual design and user experience, especially how to improve people's daily lives through technological innovation.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the future, I hope to further develop in the field of interactive design, especially exploring the application of human-computer interaction and artificial intelligence in design. I look forward to not only improving my design ability through learning, but also constantly innovating in actual projects.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There will be many difficulties in the learning process, but I will find ways to overcome them because there is a word that always inspires me.
            </p>
